            <h2 class="coding">Coding</h2>
                <p>I believe my first interest in coding was in 2013 when I learned about <a id="a" href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> platform. I tried out the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    I made my own biography briefly and I was hooked. At that time I didn't see it as a potential skill to build my career, it was just a small hobby back then. I wish I invested more time into it, but
                    unfortunately, I had other priorities. I remember doing Introduction to Computer Science course in a community college in 2006. I couldn't really understand the basics
                    of computer programming and I found my professor really boring. I think when it comes to learning, it has to be entertaining and I'm really grateful for many
                    amazing online resources to learn programming today. There's no better time to learn programming! I am now very much more determined to develop my skills 
                    hopefully land my dream job in software engineering. Better late than never, right?</p>

            <a name="sports"></a>
            <h2 class="sports">Sports</h2>
                <p>My favorite teams are Kansas City Chiefs, Kansas University Jayhawks, and Kansas City Royals. So, I basically love to follow Kansas City sports. I'm actually a 
                season ticket holder for the Chiefs home games so it's alot of fun. I do not go to every game in case anything comes up because life happens. It's
                a pretty good investment because I can sell tickets for profit. I have alot of Jayhawks fans in my family. We follow their college basketball team
                passionately. As a matter of fact, KU's basketball program is one of the richest traditions in all sports. <a id="a" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Naismith">James Naismith</a> 
                invented the game of basketball in 1891 and founded the University of Kansas basketball program. KU's basketball court is named after Naismith so it's a pretty big deal. Moving on to Royals, my favorite memory
                of them was winning the <a id="a" href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/royals-win-2015-world-series-back-in-kansas-city-they-celebrate/">World Series</a> in 2015. It was such an incredible feeling winning 
                the championship. I witnessed KU winning the <a id="a" href="https://kuathletics.com/040808aaa-775/">national championship</a> in 2008 as well. Chiefs is only one that hasn't won the championship and I pray to see them win the Super Bowl in my lifetime!</p>

            <a name="movies"></a>
            <h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
                <p>I always have been into movies growing up. Star Wars, Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, Batman, and many Disney movies. I love stories and characters so I think that's what attracted
                me to the movies. I was also fascinated by the computer generated scenes. I'm into comic books and Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. We are living in the golden
                age of comic book movies because I can't get enough of Marvel movies and TV shows. Come to think of it, <a id="a" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8e-FF8MsqU">the Matrix</a> is one of my favorite movies 
                because of its cyber-punk setting and artificial intelligence. The Matrix was released in 1999 so the technology was very, very different and outdated. It's fascinating to see how much technology have changed 
                since then. I still watch that movie today!</p>

            <a name="videogames"></a>       
            <h2 id="videogames">Video Games</h2>
                <p>Like movies, I was into computer generated scenes and graphics. <a id="a" href="https://www.nintendo.com/nes-classic/">Original Nintendo</a> was my first console and my first memory was playing Super Mario Brothers and Teenage Mutant 
                Ninja Turtles. I also grew up with Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Playstation, Playstation 2, and Xbox 360. I probably play too many of video games! If you are wondering
                what is my favorite video game, I would probably say <a id="a" href="https://kotaku.com/what-makes-ocarina-of-time-great-20-years-later-1830596483">The Legend of Zelda: Orchina of Time</a> from Nintendo 64. 
                It was such a masterpiece! The soundtrack was beautiful too. I think a part of video games is what draw me to programming. I always was curious how it worked behind the scenes, but I was too focused on playing, not how you make 
                video games work.</p>

            <a name="books"></a>
            <h2 class="books">Books</h2>
                <p>I loved reading science fiction books growing up especially Harry Potter. It's just the creativity and imagination that fascinates me, similar to movies or video games. I try
                to read up on latest technology gadgets as well. Programming books too. I started getting into stoic philosophy almost two years ago. Stoic philosophy dates back to ancient Rome.
                I love how the way they think and react to adversity and trials. It helps me maximizes positive emotions, reduces negative emotions, and hone my virtues of character. 
                Ryan Holiday is one of my favorite writers. He's one of the greatest thinkers in this generation in my opinion. I suggest you to try out one of his books, <a id="a" href="https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/B00K5JUNSU">The Obstacle Is The Way.</a></p>

            <a name="gym"></a>
            <h2 class="gym">Kickboxing</h2>
                <p>A friend recommended me to try out kickboxing two years ago while I was looking for a new gym to join. So, I found a 9Round kickboxing fitness club and tried out. 
                I fell love in kickboxing and never looked back on weightlifting because it's way more addictive. I get better results from kickboxing. It also made me gain respect for the 
                professional boxers and martial artists because it's intense work!</p>

            <a name="poker"></a> 
            <h2 class="poker">Poker</h2>
                <p>Texas hold 'em poker is one of my favorite games to play. I started playing it in high school with some of my good friends. It's very addictive. We gamble a bit too so I have went 
                    on to win a few tournaments! Nothing too dangerous like Rounders movie, haha.</p>

            <h2 class="beer">Breweries</h2>
                <p>I'm a big fan of craft beer so I like to go out and test taste new kind of beer at local breweries. Whenever I'm out of town for a vacation, I try out a random brewery. My favorite
                brewery is probably <a id="a" href="https://www.breckbrew.com/">Breckenridge Brewery</a> in Breckenridge, Colorado. Colorado is one of my favorite states to visit!</p>
